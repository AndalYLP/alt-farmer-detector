> `/reports mute other_game:False` 


## How to start
you will need the next env variables:
- **MONGO_URI**
- **COOKIE** (roblox cookie)
- **TOKEN** (discord token)

### MongoDB

For your database you need to use this structure:
- AltFarmerDetector
    - Users

### Channel Ids

For now the only way to change the report channels is going to the [constants file](src/config/constants.py).

### Host

You can host the bot for free using [Render](https://render.com/register), i recommend you to watch a tutorial on how to host a discord bot with render.

> [!NOTE]
> The bot works properly with >300 players and a free Render service,
> if you exceed this "limit" your service can get suspended due to
> a high volume of [service-initiated traffic](https://render.com/docs/free#service-initiated-traffic-threshold).
